My notes:


filename: "2017-11-09-memorygame.pdf"

---
p7:

Rename MgdGameModel -> MGGame, and there is `withNumbers` doing the same initialization, then:
`MgdGameModel new initializeForSymbols: '12345678'.`
May be: 
`MGGame withNumbers`

Also `MgdGameElement` -> `MGGameElement`


p8:

"Pharo 6.1"


p9:

Update old packages and classes names.


p15:

Old mention to BlUniverse... use BlParallelUniverse?
"Since Bloc is still under development", I'd remove this warning, that was also done at the beginning of this chapter.


p18:

Update inspector.


p22:

(And before in this chapter) I see the iteratiive improvements coexisting in MGCardElement>>#drawOnSpartaCanvas3: and similar.

Now I realize that Stef arrived until this point on his new implementation. The "3.7 Flipped side" was not implemented yet.


p23:

outdated comment: "in fact they will be removed once Pharo is based on Bloc"


p24: 

probably to update: "Cairo, Moz2D and in the future plain OpenGL."


p26:

wrong: "Figure 3-9 Not centered letter." (it IS centered)


p27:

#numbers method is renamed as withNumbers


p29:

- I realize that Stef implemented just until before "4.3 Updating the container to its children"
- Typo: "aLayoutConstrants"


p31:

Nothing implemented from this chapter. The listener was a loading problem of the original code. I reported about that: https://github.com/pharo-graphics/Tutorials/issues/2.


p32:

Remove #root (not needed)


p33:

- Paragraph misising before? "It means that the memory game model is changed but we do not see" makes no sense.
- Unreferenced: "Figure 5-2 Tracing registration to the domain notifications."
- In fact, in my code it works (with bug)


end:

Aha! now I see the book is unfinished.
